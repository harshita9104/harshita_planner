##  Major Design Decisions & Trade-offs

- **Storage & Persistence**: IndexedDB for structured data with localStorage fallback.  
  *Trade-off*: higher complexity vs. reliable offline capability.  

- **Performance Optimization**: Cursor-based pagination, indexing, and aggressive caching to scale beyond 50 activities.  
  *Trade-off*: extra setup vs. consistently smooth interactions.  

- **Offline-First Architecture**: Queue-based sync with optimistic UI to allow uninterrupted planning without connectivity.  
  *Trade-off*: storage overhead vs. seamless offline experience.  

- **Mood & Personalization**: Multi-dimensional mood/vibe system tied to contextual factors (energy, weather, time).  
  *Trade-off*: more complex logic vs. engaging, personalized suggestions.  

- **Smart Integrations**: External APIs (weather, dining, events) with graceful fallbacks.  
  *Trade-off*: API dependency vs. richer contextual features.  

- **Scalability & Maintainability**: Modular React components + design system tokens for color, spacing, and typography.  
  *Trade-off*: upfront design effort vs. long-term scalability.  

- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML, ARIA labels, and keyboard navigation built-in.  
  *Trade-off*: additional development/testing vs. inclusive, broader usability.
