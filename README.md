##  Technical Implementation

### Component Architecture
- Designed using **modular React components** (`ActivityCard`, `PlanView`, `Header`, `MoodTracker`) with minimal prop surfaces.  
- **System thinking** applied: layout, UI, and feature components separated for reusability.  
- Built a **design system** with centralized tokens for colors, typography, spacing, and shadows.

### State Management
- Implemented a **custom hook** (`useWeekendPlanner`) as a single source of truth for activities, moods, and schedules.  
- State updates follow **immutable patterns** to keep changes predictable and enable undo/redo in the future.  
- **Optimistic UI updates** give instant feedback, while a **background sync queue** reconciles with persistence asynchronously.

### Persistence & Offline-first
- **IndexedDB** (via browser APIs) used for storing structured data like activities and user preferences.  
- **localStorage fallback** ensures compatibility in older environments.  
- Plans can be created, updated, and viewed entirely offline; queued updates are synced once connectivity is restored.

### User Interface & Experience
- Applied **glassmorphism design** with translucent surfaces and blur effects for visual depth.  
- Used **gradient systems and micro-interactions** to enhance engagement.  
- Layouts adapt responsively using **CSS Grid and Flexbox** for mobile-first design.  
- Added **drag-and-drop interactions** with visual feedback and conflict detection in the planner.

### Performance Optimization
- Implemented **cursor-based pagination and indexing** for browsing activities.  
- **Memoization and selective re-renders** ensure smooth performance even with large datasets.  
- Used **lazy-loading** for non-critical assets to optimize load time.

### Accessibility & Inclusivity
- Semantic HTML5 elements with **ARIA attributes** for screen reader compatibility.  
- Full **keyboard navigation support**, including drag-and-drop actions.  
- Color palette tuned for **WCAG AA contrast compliance**.

### Smart Integrations
- **Weather API (Open-Meteo)** integration provides real-time forecasts with smart recommendations (e.g., swap outdoor activities in bad weather).  
- **Holiday awareness system** suggests upcoming long weekends.  
- External event & dining APIs enrich the weekend planning experience, with **caching and fallbacks** for reliability.
